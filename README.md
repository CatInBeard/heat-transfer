# heat-transfer
Bachelor's Thesis

## Description
This project is a CAE web application for calculating thermal conductivity in a two-dimensional case. To work with it, you need an .inp file. After uploading the .inp file, you can modify certain material settings and boundary conditions. Following this, you can compute thermal conductivity and obtain graphs.
